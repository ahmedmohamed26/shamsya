## **Information**

* I've using **Prettier** as a default code formatter.
* I've using **ESlint** as a default linter in development process.
* I can't do chart manual i think something wrong for this point but i'm install chart js and integrate it with fake data
* I can do unit testing using karma with angular but I have not tried it before using jest with react but i know jest with javascript

## **Enhancements**

* Enhance the project & make the component more reusable..


## **Why I didn't finish the chart page manual  ?**

* I couldn't get enough free time at work.
* We got to publish to product the last month, and I have worked with hotfixes in the two weeks.
* Many companies have sent me their tasks while I am doing the work, most of them are beside my work.
